For this assignment, we created a password generator. 
The password generator needed to include a prompt asking how many characters the user would like to have. If they chose inbetween 8-128 they are able to proceed forward with more questions. If they chose below 8 or above 128 they were alerted to choose a length between 8-128.
Once length is chosen the user is asked 4 more questions about if they would like to use lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters. 
If none are selected, the user is alerted they must select at least one of the criteria to continue. 
If criteria is met, the user recieves a randomly generated password.
